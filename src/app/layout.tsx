/**
 * Root Layout - The Foundation of Your Web3 Application
 * 
 * This file serves as the foundation for your entire application. Think of it
 * like the electrical panel in a house - if it's not properly wired, nothing
 * else in the house will work correctly, no matter how good the individual
 * components are.
 * 
 * The critical insight here is that Web3 functionality (including wallet
 * connections) requires a specific provider hierarchy to be established at
 * the root level. Every page and component in your app inherits from this
 * layout, so if the providers aren't properly configured here, wallet
 * connections won't work anywhere in your application.
 * 
 * Key Changes Made to Fix Provider Issues:
 * 1. Replaced individual providers with AllProviders for proper hierarchy
 * 2. Ensured AuthProvider is available to all components
 * 3. Added development debugging to help identify configuration issues
 * 4. Maintained proper import order for CSS styles

/**
 * Environment Variables Checklist
 * 
 * For wallet connections to work properly, make sure you have these
 * environment variables configured in your .env.local file:
 * 
 * Required for basic functionality:
 * - NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID (get from WalletConnect Cloud)
 * - NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY (get from Alchemy dashboard)
 * 
 * Optional for enhanced features:
 * - NEXT_PUBLIC_COINBASE_PROJECT_ID (for Coinbase-specific features)
 * - NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY (for OnchainKit enhanced UI)
 * - NEXT_PUBLIC_BICONOMY_PAYMASTER_API_KEY (for gasless transactions)
 * 
 * The ProviderDebugInfo component will show you which of these
 * are properly configured when you run the app in development mode.

/**
 * Testing Your Provider Fix
 * 
 * After applying these changes, test your provider setup by:
 * 1. Starting your development server (npm run dev)
 * 2. Navigate to your dashboard page
 * 3. Check the debug info in the bottom-left corner
 * 4. You should see both AuthProvider and Web3Provider showing as available
 * 5. The dashboard should load without the "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider" error
 * 
 * If you still see errors, check the ProviderDebugInfo
 * in the bottom-left corner for configuration issues, and look at
 * the browser console for any error messages.
