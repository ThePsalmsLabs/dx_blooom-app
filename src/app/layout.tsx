/**
 * Root Layout - The Foundation of Your Web3 Application
 * 
 * This file serves as the foundation for your entire application. Think of it
 * like the electrical panel in a house - if it's not properly wired, nothing
 * else in the house will work correctly, no matter how good the individual
 * components are.
 * 
 * The critical insight here is that Web3 functionality (including wallet
 * connections) requires a specific provider hierarchy to be established at
 * the root level. Every page and component in your app inherits from this
 * layout, so if the providers aren't properly configured here, wallet
 * connections won't work anywhere in your application.
 * 
 * Key Changes Made to Fix Provider Issues:
 * 1. Replaced individual providers with UnifiedAppProvider for proper hierarchy
 * 2. Ensured AuthProvider is available to all components
 * 3. Added development debugging to help identify configuration issues
 * 4. Maintained proper import order for CSS styles
