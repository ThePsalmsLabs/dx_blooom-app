// =============================================================================
// PHASE 3: SWAP FUNCTIONALITY - TOKEN EXCHANGE SYSTEM
// =============================================================================

/**
 * Phase 3 creates a sophisticated yet user-friendly token swapping system that
 * integrates seamlessly with your existing Commerce Protocol infrastructure.
 * 
 * Think of this as building a financial concierge service - it understands what
 * users need, calculates the best way to get it, handles all the complex
 * blockchain interactions, and provides clear feedback throughout the process.
 * 
 * Educational Framework for Phase 3:
 * - User Psychology: Transform goal interruption into helpful guidance
 * - Technical Integration: Leverage existing Commerce Protocol swap capabilities
 * - Error Recovery: Handle failures gracefully with clear next steps
 * - Progressive Disclosure: Show complexity only when users need it
 * - Contextual Intelligence: Remember why users initiated the swap
 */

/**
 * Advanced Swap Calculation Hook
 * 
 * This hook is the "brain" of our swap system. It takes two tokens and an amount,
 * then calculates all the information users need to make informed decisions.
 * 
 * Educational Concept: Financial Mathematics in DeFi
 * Swapping tokens isn't just about exchange rates - we need to consider:
 * - Price impact (how our trade affects the market price)
 * - Slippage tolerance (price changes during transaction execution)
 * - Gas costs (blockchain transaction fees)
 * - Route optimization (finding the best path through liquidity pools)
 * 
 * This hook abstracts all this complexity into simple, user-friendly information.
